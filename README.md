- 👋 Hi, I’m @wariley46
- 👀 I’m interested in ... whatever my kiddos are interested in at the moment. Besides that, I enjoy baseball, football, real estate, grilling, politics, and coding, among other things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... well, I'm just diving back into coding for the first time since high school. For now I'm sharpening my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... any basic projects where I can learn from other programmers.  
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I spent a year living in Chile in college and it was amazing.
