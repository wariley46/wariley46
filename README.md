- 👋 Hi, I’m @wariley46
- 👀 I’m interested in ... whatever my kiddos are interested in at the moment. Besides that, I enjoy baseball, football, real estate, grilling, politics, and coding, among other things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... well, I'm just diving back into coding for the first time since high school over ten years ago. For now I'm just sharpening my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... any basic projects where I can learn from other programmers.  
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I met my wife in Africa, though she is not African but rather Hispanic.
